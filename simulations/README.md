# Simulations

Here is the code used to generate the data in Figures 3-5. Each figure has three different models (Enriched Dirichlet Process, Dirichlet Process, and Mixed Effects) across four different simulation scenarios. The files named "sim1.r", "sim2.r", "sim3.r", and "sim4.r" are the EDP models for each scenario, respectively.  Similarly, "sim1DP.r" refers to the DP model for scenario 1. And "sim1_ME.r" to the parametric mixed effects model for scenario 1.

The file "compile_res.r" takes all the results and compiles them to get the data in the figure.
