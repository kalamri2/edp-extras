# Data Analysis

All data analysis code for our paper is contained here. We have R scripts to predict missing HbA1c, fasting glucose, and random glucose. Lastly, we include an R script to calculate incidence of Type II Diabetes.

## Data source 

Our data comes the Sentinel Database (https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/) and our work is based off the paper "Missing laboratory results data in electronic health databases: implications for monitoring diabetes risk" by Flory et al. in the Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research (Vol. 6, No. 1).
